🚲 Exploring Urban Mobility with Data!

I recently completed a data analysis project on a Bike Rental dataset, diving into how environmental and seasonal factors influence bike-sharing behavior.

🔍 Key Steps:

Cleaned and explored the data

Visualized usage patterns across seasons, weather, and holidays

Built regression models to predict daily bike rentals

Derived insights into user behavior (e.g., higher rentals on clear, working days)

🔧 Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
